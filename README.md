The N-Queen Simulation Project is a visual and interactive tool that demonstrates the solution to the classic N-Queens problem in computer science and mathematics. The N-Queens problem involves placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other — meaning, no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

# This simulation is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it allows users to-->

* Select the number of queens (value of N)

* Visually see how queens are placed on the board

* Observe the backtracking algorithm in action

* Understand step-by-step how conflicts are avoided

* The primary objective of this project is to teach and demonstrate backtracking algorithms in an engaging and visual way.
